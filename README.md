# Weather App

A weather app which shows current weather of a city. It uses [OpenWeathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch the weather data. It uses [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the location to show the weather accordingly.

The app also changes **background** according to different weather conditions.
